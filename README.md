## Step 1

Currently, no information is available for the first step. (If you discover it, please open an issue or PR to update this README!)

## Step 2 – The Punch Arm

This step requires motion controls:

- Equip your Joy-Cons.
- Punch with your left Joy-Con → increases the left counter
- Punch with your right Joy-Con → increases the right counter
- Continue until both counters reach 77.
