## Step 1

Currently, no information is available for the first step. (If you discover it, please open an issue or PR to update this README!)

## Step 2 – The Punch Arm

This step requires motion controls:

- Equip your Joy-Cons.
- Punch with your left Joy-Con → increases the left counter
- Punch with your right Joy-Con → increases the right counter
- Continue until both counters reach 77.

## Step 3 – Next & Lock

Punch to cycle through to the next number.
Use your sonar to lock in the current number, then move on to the next of the three numbers.

## Step 4 - Directions

if you punch the Fractone from different directions you cycle trou different numbers

## Step 5 - Solve the Code

So you dont have to transform having the transformation highlighted is all you need.

|Transformation|1|2|3|4|5|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Kong|1|1|0|0|1|
|Zebra|1|1|1|0|0|
|Ostrich|1|0|0|0|1|
|Snake|0|0|1|1|1|
|Elefant|1|0|0|1|1|
